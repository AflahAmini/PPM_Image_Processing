Title: PPM Image Processing and Effects in C++

Project Description:

Created a C++ structure called "Pixel" to represent RGB components of a graphic point.
Developed an "Image" class with private attributes for file metadata and a dynamically allocated pixel raster image.
Implemented member functions for reading and writing .ppm text format image files.
Included functionality to mirror the image vertically.
Extended the class to incorporate a sepia filter effect for images.
Added a function to generate a strip curtain effect on images.
Tools/Technologies Used:

Language: C++
File Format: ASCII-coded Portable Pix Map (.ppm)
IDE/Editor: Codeblocks
This project showcases proficiency in C++ programming, file I/O operations, dynamic memory allocation, image processing algorithms (like the sepia filter), and menu-driven user interactions. It demonstrates skills in handling image files and applying basic image effects programmatically using C++.
